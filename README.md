# The Event
PyLadies LA is having a three-part workshop series in 2019 May:

- [Python for Data Part 1 || Cleaning Data with Basic Pandas](https://www.meetup.com/Pyladies-LA/events/zswgwqyzhbmb/), on May 9, 2019
- [Python for Data Part 2 || Data Mining with Advanced Pandas](https://www.meetup.com/Pyladies-LA/events/zswgwqyzhbvb/), on May 16, 2019 
- [Python for Data Part 3 || Data Visualization w/ Matplotlib & Seaborn](https://www.meetup.com/Pyladies-LA/events/260722547/), on May 23, 2019


## About the Workshop

This 3-part course is targeted toward Python users with around 20+ hours of ACTIVE coding experience. While we will cover a basic introduction to Pandas and plotting in Python, you should feel comfortable reading and writing pure Python.

- Differences between basic Python types (str, int, float, etc)
- How dictionaries work (keying into dictionary values)
- Basic list operations
- Basic control flow (for loops)
- Basic numpy operations (selecting rows and columns, math operations)
- Basic data literacy (differences between continuous, discrete, and categorical data)
- Basic visual literacy (how to read a bar graph and a scatter plot)
- **Must be comfortable running code in a Jupyter environment**
- **Must be comfortable working in python 3.6+**

As a point of reference, if the idea of independently looking through [this](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html) scares you, the pace of the course may be too aggressive for you.
